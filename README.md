The page allows you to search the marvel api by typing in the search box.
It shows results after a minimum of two letters entered.
After results are visible you can clear the search bar with the clear button.
Or you can select a character and it will open up a new tab displaying their picture.
You can also scroll the response up to the first 10 results.
